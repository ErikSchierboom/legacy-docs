We are working to improve this documentation.

If you find any part of it confusing, or if you can't figure out how to get started with something, then rest assured **it's not you, it's us!** Please [open up a new issue](https://github.com/exercism/docs/issues) to describe what you were hoping to contribute with, and what you're wondering about, and we'll figure out together how to improve the documentation.
